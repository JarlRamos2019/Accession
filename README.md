# Accession
Program that simulates the accessioning of patient data from urine and oral fluid samples. This is meant to emulate laboratory information management software used in a healthcare setting dealing with urinalysis or drug testing. This program assumes that the organization using it takes only urine and oral fluid samples from healthcare providers that act as its clients. It also assumes that any demographic information obtained from patient sheets and test requisitions accompanying the urine/oral fluid samples will be entered manually. In this program, the user will interface with an accession log carrying multiple patient records and will be presented with several functions that will operate on the accession log. One of these functions is inputting new patient data, where the user can fill out information such as patient name and date of birth (DOB). This information will be captured in an instantiated object representing the accession data and will be added to the accession log object. The user also has the option to view the full accession log. They can also search for specific accessions by entering the accession ID and will be able to obtain patient information as well as a list of medications if the patient is taking any. Once the user quits from the program, it will generate an output file containing the accession log before quitting.
